# -------------------
# Background Information
#
# In this problem, you will build a planner that helps a robot
# find the shortest way in a warehouse filled with boxes
# that he has to pick up and deliver to a drop zone.
#For example:
#
#warehouse = [[ 1, 2, 3],
#             [ 0, 0, 0],
#             [ 0, 0, 0]]
#dropzone = [2,0] 
#todo = [2, 1]
# Robot starts at the dropzone.
# Dropzone can be in any free corner of the warehouse map.
# todo is a list of boxes to be picked up and delivered to dropzone. 
# Robot can move diagonally, but the cost of diagonal move is 1.5 
# Cost of moving one step horizontally or vertically is 1.0
# If the dropzone is at [2, 0], the cost to deliver box number 2
# would be 5.

# To pick up a box, robot has to move in the same cell with the box.
# When a robot picks up a box, that cell becomes passable (marked 0)
# Robot can pick up only one box at a time and once picked up 
# he has to return it to the dropzone by moving on to the cell.
# Once the robot has stepped on the dropzone, his box is taken away
# and he is free to continue with his todo list.
# Tasks must be executed in the order that they are given in the todo.
# You may assume that in all warehouse maps all boxes are
# reachable from beginning (robot is not boxed in).

# -------------------
# User Instructions
#
# Design a planner (any kind you like, so long as it works).
# This planner should be a function named plan() that takes
# as input three parameters: warehouse, dropzone and todo. 
# See parameter info below.
#
# Your function should RETURN the final, accumulated cost to do
# all tasks in the todo list in the given order and this cost
# must which should match with our answer).
# You may include print statements to show the optimum path,
# but that will have no effect on grading.
#
# Your solution must work for a variety of warehouse layouts and
# any length of todo list.
# Add your code at line 76.
# 
# --------------------
# Parameter Info
#
# warehouse - a grid of values. where 0 means that the cell is passable,
# and a number between 1 and 99 shows where the boxes are.
# dropzone - determines robots start location and place to return boxes 
# todo - list of tasks, containing box numbers that have to be picked up
#
# --------------------
# Testing
#
# You may use our test function below, solution_check
# to test your code for a variety of input parameters.
